# C2-D-115-trapezoid-kickbin


The C2-D-115 trapezoid Kickbin was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started back in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

# About Paraflex
This is the trapezoid version of the C2-D-115 Kickbin is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions. With a compact size of 24x24x24 Inch its a managable cube with high output.

# Working range
Great PA kickbin cabinet which add exciting dynamics, detail and warmth to a system while also increasing headroom. What kickbins will contribute to your rig is the sort of energetic and lively sound that inspires people to dance, with a fundamental tuning of 74Hz (Fb) up to 400hz, for a more extended upper range, check out the 'Mullins mod' versions of the C2D-115 snd C2D-112, named after the modification made by Josh Mullins. We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofer and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
